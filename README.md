Music Hacks 2017 Project

This project aimed to automatically reorganize Spotify playlist based on the stored metrics of each individual song. Users pick a playlist, which metric to sort by, and a graph that shapes the order of the playlist. (Many online website could sort high to low, or low to high, but none offered graph matching to bell shaped curves. We stepped in to fill this void.)
